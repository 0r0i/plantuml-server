* How to build the project
**************************
To build the project you need to install the following components :
- java jdk 1.6.0 or above
- apache tomcat 6.0 or above
- apache ant 1.7 or above 

If the tomcat home directory is not /tomcat, you have to create at
the root of the project a text file named user.property and 
containing the following line:
tomcat-home=<your tomcat home dir>  

For example, on a Windows environment, your user.property file can be:
tomcat-home=C:/tools/Tomcat6.0 

To build the war, just run "ant" at the root directory of the project.
